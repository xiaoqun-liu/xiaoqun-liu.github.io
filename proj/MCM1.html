                        Wordle is a word guessing game that appears on the back of the New York Times newspaper and also has an online version for people to enjoy. The words are all five letters long, and players have a limited number of guesses. Each correct guess returns information on whether the guessed word is in the target word and if so, its correct position. Some players share their results on Twitter. COMAP collected data from players who shared their results on Twitter in 2022 (number of guesses and whether they guessed the word). Based on this data, we need to predict the daily number of players for the company (using an ARIMA model), determine the distribution of the number of attempts for any given word (using Random Forests), and further assess the difficulty of guessing a particular word (using K-means clustering). Finally, we propose strategies for improving game quality for Wordle based on this analysis. Additionally, using the Monte Carlo algorithm, we've designed a word guessing machine that maximizes the probability of guessing the word（Wordle’s word dataset is scraped online）. This machine indicates that the number of attempts people actually need to guess the word is much higher than the number of attempts shared on Twitter.

                                        At the start of 2022, images of green and yellow squares began cropping up on Twitter, when
the pandemic spreading wide on earth with people quarantined at home. It a flash in the pan and
quickly gets off-booming in June which provides a good sample for Dataminer to find the regular
pattern for multitude and the sociology behind.

Wordle has established itself as a popular word puzzle game by 2022. After a year, the number
of Wordle players progressively decreased, and the reported data appeared to be steady. Using the
dataset provided by Twitter, we were able to derive a lot of information, such as forecasting the trend
of the number of people who play the game in the future and obtaining results of difficulties related
to various words in word puzzles. These results will be of great significance for the company to
make strategies to popularize their game.
<br><br>
Regarding the issue at hand in this competition, we created various models for various queries
to better suit the data while yielding results. Before focusing on the need, we cleaned the data,
corrected a few of its flaws, and took a quick look at its characteristics.
In problem 1(a), we applied ARIMA (4,1,2) model to predict the number of people who
reported their results on March,1,2023, and tested it with random forest method. The number of
reported results predicted by ARIMA is 19698. In order to further verify the reliability of our
model, we applied our model to predict number in February,1,2023, results showed that the real
data is also in our predicted interval, which was quite good. For problem 1(b), we use hypothesis
testing, and found that there’s no high correlation between some basic attributes (word frequency,
part-of-speech, sentiment).
<br><br>
In problem 2, we first created 5 factors that could affect outcomes in order to estimate the quantity
of a specific term in the future: Text_rate, Green_score, Yellow_score, Combination_score,
Entropy and employ regression using Random Forest Regression. Using the prediction model
created in Problem 1, we replace the time parameters in this case with the number of persons. The
predicted distribution percentage of "EERIE" is [ 0%, 3%, 17%, 37%, 32%, 10%, 0% ].
<br><br>
In order to categorize the phrases for issue 3, we utilize K-means clustering and split them into
4 classes: Simple, Ordinary, Rather Difficult and Difficult. We base our standards on the means
and standard deviation of test results. The word "EERIE" is categorized as Rather Difficult using
the Random Forest Classification.
<br><br>
We attempt to recover all users’ data for the final question rather than just those who contributed
their answers. To do this, we create an algorithm that mimics human word guessing based on
Wordle’s word statistics and English word frequency, and we uncover a wealth of intriguing data
by taking into account players who tweet their game results.
