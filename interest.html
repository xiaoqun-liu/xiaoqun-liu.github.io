                        I have a profound curiosity about the world, , and I'm eager to explore various topics throughout my life. I'm open to all ideas that arise. As Professor Xin Yao advised, regardless of your interests, the key is to delve deeper. Research fields often intersect at the highest levels, regardless of the discipline.

                        As I have delineated a distinct area of focus under the umbrella of Linguistics, let's concentrate on the theoretical foundations and practical applications of NLP across various domains. This includes a keen emphasis on DL applications in NLP and the evolving landscape of LLMs.
                        <br><strong><u>Neural Network Architectures</u></strong> Explore various neural network architectures tailored for NLP tasks, such as CNNs, RNNs, transformer and the most popular GRU, developing more effective NLP solutions.
                        <br><strong><u>Transfer Learning</u></strong> The advent of transfer learning has revolutionized NLP on investigating how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, enhancing performance while reducing extensive labeled datasets.
                        <br><strong><u>LLM Alignment</u></strong> Ensure LLMs align with human values and intentions, including the development of feedback mechanisms and ethical guidelines for LLM deployment. I will investigate potential vulnerabilities, including adversarial attacks, and develop strategies to fortify models against such threats, such as <a href="proj/align.html">a previous work</a>.
                        <br><strong><u>Multimodal LLMs</u></strong> enable models to process and generate content across multiple modalities. How integrating textual, visual, and auditory information can enhance understanding and generation capabilities. 
                        <br><strong><u>Tool Learning</strong> Using External Tools with LLMs</u> I am currently conducting <a href="proj/tool.html">experiments</a> in this area, examining how LLMs can interact with APIs, databases, and other resources to enrich their outputs. 
                        <br><strong><u>Interpreting LLM Decisions and Explainable AI</u></strong> To understand how LLMs arrive at their decisions, including attention mechanism, saliency map, addressing concerns related to bias, fairness, and ethical decision-making. 
                        <br><strong><u>Causal Reasoning</u></strong> is understanding and explaining events or phenomena by analyzing the causal relationships between variables. I aim to explore how LLMs can be designed to infer causal relationships from textual data.
                        <br><strong><u>Pruning, Sparsity, Quantization and Distillation</u></strong> Interested in exploring techniques to reduce the size and compute complexity of LLMs without sacrificing performance, essential for resource-constrained deplopment.
                        <br><strong><u>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs</u></strong> RAG combines the strengths of retrieval systems with generative models. I am interested in how this hybrid approach can improve the accuracy and relevance of generated content, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. 

                        <br><span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Linguistic</span> I am interested in the intersection of philosophy and computer science, namely Linguistic. I will focus on the theory and application of Linguistic in various fields, mainly on the theory and application of it.
                        <br><strong><u>Linguistic Theory in NLP</u></strong> Understanding the linguistic principles underlying NLP is paramount. This involves exploring syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to inform model design and improve language understanding. I aim to investigate how linguistic theories can enhance the performance and interpretability of NLP systems.
                        <br><strong><u>Cognitive Models</u></strong> I am interested in how human language processing can inform NLP algorithms, includeing studying attention mechanisms, memory utilization, and the cognitive load during language comprehension. 
                        <br><strong><u>Enhancing Cross-Lingual Capabilities</u></strong> Improving the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs is essential for global applications. I will investigate methods for multilingual training, zero-shot learning, and cross-lingual transfer to enhance language understanding and generation across diverse linguistic contexts.

                        <br><span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Evolutionary Computation</span> I am interested in the application of evolutionary algorithms(EA) in optimization, machine learning, and data mining. I will focus on the theory and application of EA in various fields, mainly on the theory of EA and the application of EA in optimization.
                        <br><strong><u>Online Learning</u></strong> The nexus of online learning and EAs. I will focus on the theory and application of online learning in various fields, mainly on the theory of online learning and the application of online learning in EAs.
                        <br><strong><u>Memrister Computing</u></strong> As my first exploration in computer science, thought it more related with hardware computation, I still have a screte interest in the application of memristor computing in machine learning and optimization. I will focus on the theory and application of memristor computing in various fields, mainly on the theory of memristor computing and the application of memristor computing in machine learning.
